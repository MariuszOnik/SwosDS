# swos-vm-c

Experimental, parallel approach to `../swos-ds`: instead of re-deriving SWOS
match mechanics by reading `swos-port`'s C++ and guessing, this mechanically
ports OpenSWOS's `game/scripts/SwosVm` + `game/scripts/Sim/Port` (C#, MIT
licensed, ~33k lines across 56 files) to portable C, preserving memory
addresses/offsets rather than jumping straight to idiomatic C structs. See
`../DEVLOG.md`, 2026-09-15 entry, and `../audyt-openswos-sim.md` for the
full rationale and tick-order audit this is based on.

`../swos-ds` is **not touched** by this experiment — its own history is
frozen at the `pre-openswos-port-experiment` tag so the two approaches can
be compared without risk to either.

## Why mechanical, not idiomatic

OpenSWOS's `Sim/Port` code is unusually densely cited back to the original
disassembly (`// updatePlayers.cpp:7604-7891`, `// swos.asm:203952`, with
`goto`-labels kept under their original names like `cseg_80E8F`). Porting
address-for-address lets us diff against that citation trail line by line;
switching straight to idiomatic C structs would require re-deriving which
struct field a given offset means *while also* translating language, which
is where hand-ported-from-scratch physics tends to quietly diverge (this is
exactly what happened in `swos-ds` — see `PHYSICS_ANALYSIS.md`). Once a
module's mechanical port passes its tests, it's a candidate for a later,
separate idiomatic-struct pass — not before.

## Layout

- `include/swos_addr.h` — **generated**, do not hand-edit. Every named
  memory offset from `SwosVm.Memory.Addr` (384 constants).
- `include/generated/swos_tables_data.h` — **generated**, do not hand-edit.
  Literal data tables (RNG permutation table, sine/cosine, angle-tangent)
  extracted verbatim rather than retyped, to rule out transcription errors.
- `include/`, `src/` — hand-ported modules (see status below). Each `.c`/`.h`
  carries `SOURCE:` (exact OpenSWOS file/lines) and `FIDELITY:` tags per
  entry.
- `tools/convert_addr.py`, `tools/extract_table.py` — the generators for the
  two generated headers above. Re-run them if OpenSWOS's `Memory.cs` /
  `Rng.cs` / `Tables.cs` change; never edit their output by hand.
- `tests/test_memory.c` — desktop smoke test (new code, not a port of
  anything) that cross-checks the ported layer against the literal comments
  in the C# source.

## Fidelity tags

Every ported function/file is tagged, per the plan in DEVLOG.md:

- `VERIFIED_PC` — direct mechanical port, PC-mode behavior confirmed against
  the OpenSWOS source comment or a cited `swos-port` line.
- `AMIGA_VARIANT` — PC path ported; the Amiga-mode alternative (see
  `audyt-openswos-sim.md` Part 0.4, "Krok 0") is not wired in yet.
- `INFERRED` — OpenSWOS's own comments mark this as reconstructed/guessed
  behavior, not read from disassembly.
- `PORT_EXTENSION` — OpenSWOS-only code with no original-SWOS equivalent
  (skip when porting into this repo, or mark clearly if kept for
  plumbing reasons).
- `FIDELITY_DIFFERENCE` — OpenSWOS and `swos-port` disagree on this point.
  Port OpenSWOS's behavior as written regardless; this tag exists to flag
  the disagreement for a later, separate decision — never to justify
  "fixing" it during the port itself.

**Correction (2026-09-15, after step 2's review): this is backwards from how
the experiment actually needs to run.** `../swos-port` (checked out as
reference in the sibling project) is **auxiliary-only** — read it to
understand *why* an OpenSWOS offset/comment looks the way it does, or to
write up a discrepancy note. Never use it to override OpenSWOS's C#: not the
translation, not an offset, not a type, not the order of operations, not the
logic. The point of this experiment is "does OpenSWOS's *actual, working* VM
mechanically port to C and run on DS" — that question only has a clean
answer if `swos-vm-c` first matches OpenSWOS byte-for-byte, including
anywhere OpenSWOS itself might be wrong relative to the original SWOS. If
OpenSWOS and swos-port disagree: port OpenSWOS as written, note the
disagreement (`FIDELITY_DIFFERENCE`), and leave the fix for a later, separate
pass — never fix it silently in the same commit as the port. (Step 2 found
zero real disagreements after full offset verification — see its status
entry below — so this rule hasn't been exercised in anger yet, but it's the
standing rule going forward.)

## Status (2026-09-15)

Step 1 of the porting order (Memory / Flags / Rng / Tables) is **partially**
done:

| Module | State |
|---|---|
| `swos_addr.h` (`Memory.Addr`) | Done — generated, 384/384 constants |
| `swos_tables_data.h` (`Rng.kRandomTable`, `Tables.k*`) | Done — generated |
| `swos_flags.{h,c}` (`Flags.cs`) | Done — full hand port |
| `swos_rng.{h,c}` (`Rng.cs`) | Done — full hand port (both streams) |
| `swos_memory.{h,c}` Read/Write helpers | Done — full hand port |
| `swos_memory` `Init()` (`Memory.cs:1477-2271`, ~800 lines) | **Not ported.** It calls `PlayerSprite.Init()` / `AnimationTablesData.Init()` / `TeamData.Init()`, none of which exist here yet (those are step 2). Porting it now would mean stubbing those three calls, which would misrepresent this layer as more complete than it is. `swosMemoryInitStub()` (zero-fill only) stands in for now. |

`make test` builds and runs the smoke test (desktop-only; see Makefile
comment for why it pins devkitPro's bundled mingw64 gcc as the *host*
compiler — unrelated to the project's actual ARM/BlocksDS target toolchain).

**Step 1 hardening pass (same day, after external review):** the Read/Write
layer had a latent UB bug (see swos_memory.c) and two signatures took `int`
where an unsigned type was actually required; both fixed. `swosRngReseed()`
was re-tagged `PORT_EXTENSION` (not `VERIFIED_PC`) — it's an OpenSWOS policy
with no equivalent in `swos-port`'s `random.cpp`, which never reseeds at
all; see swos_rng.h for the full note. Added RNG golden vectors computed
independently in Python (not by calling this repo's C code) and flag
boundary tests (signed overflow, unsigned carry-out). Added `.gitattributes`
so regenerating the two generated headers doesn't show as line-ending-only
diffs. All Read/Write/View calls are now bounds-checked via `assert()`
(no-op under `NDEBUG`, so a release/DS build pays nothing).

## Status: step 2 (2026-09-15)

`BallSprite.cs`, `PlayerSprite.cs`, `TeamData.cs` fully ported
(`swos_ball_sprite.{h,c}`, `swos_player_sprite.{h,c}`, `swos_team_data.{h,c}`)
including `PlayerSprite.Init()` and `TeamData.Init()`. `tests/test_sprites.c`
(new, 44 checks) covers: every offset re-derived independently from
`swos-port`'s packed `struct Sprite`/`struct TeamGeneralInfo` (auxiliary
verification only, per the corrected rule above — see each header's SOURCE
comment for the derivation), round-trips for every ported field including a
neighbouring-slot isolation check (catches a wrong `SlotStride`), and both
`Init()` functions' full contract (22-slot defaults, ordinal/team-number
assignment, pointer-table population, cross-team `opponentsTeam` pointers,
and confirming the documented "does NOT clear the energy padding region"
behavior). `make test` (both suites): 70/70 pass.

**Discrepancy summary vs OpenSWOS/swos-port** (informational only — nothing
below caused a code change, per the corrected fidelity rule):

- OpenSWOS's `OffAnimTablePtr`/`OffFrameIndicesTable` are 4-byte pointer
  fields; swos-port's `struct Sprite` has 2-byte fields at those same start
  offsets (`animTable`, `frameIndicesTable`) each followed by a 2-byte `tag`
  padding field. OpenSWOS deliberately widened each pair into one dword (its
  own `AnimationTablesData` system stores real Memory addresses, not
  swos-port's narrower in-table index) — confirmed by usage across
  `SpriteUpdate.cs`/`BallUpdate.cs`/`UpdatePlayers.cs`, all `ReadSignedDword`.
  Every other struct offset lines up exactly once this widening is accounted
  for (verified field-by-field through the full 110-byte struct). Ported as
  OpenSWOS defines it.
- `swos-port`'s `TeamGeneralInfo` has a `wonTheBallTimer` field (offset 138,
  between `AiBallSpinDirection`/136 and `goalkeeperPlaying`/140) that
  OpenSWOS's `TeamData.cs` never exposes at all — a real gap in OpenSWOS
  itself, not a translation error. Left out here too, matching OpenSWOS.
  Flagged because `wonTheBallTimer` is one of the variables the original
  reverse-engineering brief (`../audyt-openswos-sim.md`) named as a key
  dribble/tackle-contest variable — it will likely need to be added once
  `PlayerActions`/`PlayerControlled` (steps 5-6) are ported. That's a
  decision for then, not now.
- OpenSWOS's `TeamData.OffOfs108` is an unidentified-field placeholder name;
  swos-port has since identified the same offset as `ballDirectionChangeTimer`.
  Cosmetic only (same offset, same 145-byte total struct size either way).
- Every other offset in all three files matches swos-port's packed struct
  layout exactly — no other disagreements found.

`swos_memory`'s `Init()` (deferred in step 1 because it calls into these
three files) is now unblockable, but porting it was out of scope for this
step and hasn't been done — `swosMemoryInitStub()` (zero-fill only) still
stands in. Candidate for a small step-2.5, or fold into step 3.

## Porting order (full plan)

1. ~~Memory, types, CPU flags, tables, RNG~~ (2026-09-15, see Status above)
2. ~~Sprite views: `BallSprite`, `PlayerSprite`, `TeamData`~~ (2026-09-15, see Status above)
3. `SpriteUpdate`
4. `BallUpdate`
5. `PlayerActions`
6. `PlayerControlled`
7. `UpdatePlayers`
8. `InputControls`
9. `AiHelpers`, `AiBrain`
10. `SetPieces`, `GameTime`, `Referee`
11. `GameLoop` orchestration
12. Adapter from VM state to the DS renderer (mirrors `swos-ds`'s
    `game_state.c` `swosTick()` boundary)

After each module: desktop build + tests, diff against OpenSWOS behavior
where practical, periodic `.nds` build once there's something to render.
